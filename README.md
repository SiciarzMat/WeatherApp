## General info

Are you curious what's the weather outside? Are you too lazy to just peek through the window? Or maybe you would like to know how is the weather in Tokyo, Sydney or Berlin?

Thanks to this app, all you have to do is type the name of the city you'd like to check and within mere seconds you'll discover the current weather there. No more peeking through the window required!

Working on this repository helped me to train vanilla JS functions and logic, and working with REST API and AJAX.
